# a8-mcintie-portfolio - CS 290 - Fall 2023

Welcome to my web development portfolio. The goal of this project 
is to create a portfolio website that will showcase my work 
in this class and beyond.

Pages include:
- Home
- Closet (a full-stack app with a MongoDB database)
- Topics 
- Gallery
- Contact

You can find a screenshot of the Closet (Log) in the parent directory,
and in the /images folder of the frontend. If you have any questions
setting up and testing this project, please let me know.

Thank you for all of your guidance this term. I hope you have a great
winter break!

Regards,
E.A. McIntire
